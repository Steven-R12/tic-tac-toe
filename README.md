# tic-tac-toe

*A game like no other.*

*A game that requires intellectual skill in observation.*

*A game that questions your ability to outmaneuver your opponent.*

**What is this game?**

Tic Tac Toe is a strategy game where you try to match your shape in a grid of 3 rows and 3 columns.

Each player has their own symbol, either "X" or "O".

The players compete in trying to get their symbol in a row. Either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

**How Do you play?**

Players take turns in placing their symbol in an empty square within the grid

Placing your symbol is simple. All you have to do is select the number that you want your symbol to be in. 

The grid is marked by the following:

123

456

789

You are not allowed to remove players symbols from their position, You must select a number where a symbol is not taken

If a player successfully forms a row of three of their symbols, they win the game and recieve a point! If the game results in a draw then no players get a point.
